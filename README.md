### The project
The Spanish Fleets that sailed between the 16th and 18th centuries inaugurated the modern global system we live in today.
They transported all sorts of resources, people, and knowledge between the Americas and Europe leaving behind extensive documentation.
Using innovative computational methods based on artificial intelligence, the New Spain Fleets (NSF) project is creating a step-change in the way historical archaeology collects evidence and analyses information while transforming our knowledge about the New Spain Fleets.
